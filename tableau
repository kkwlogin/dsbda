Dataset: iris.csv
Example: Visualize the distribution of Petal Length.
Steps:
•	Drag PetalLengthCm to Columns.
•	Drag PetalLengthCm again to Rows.
•	Set the chart type to Line Chart or Histogram.
•	This shows a linear distribution of one variable (1D).
Dataset: iris.csv
Example: Compare Petal Length vs Petal Width.
Steps:
•	Drag PetalLengthCm to Columns.
•	Drag PetalWidthCm to Rows.
•	Choose Scatter Plot.
•	Color by Species to add class differentiation.
Dataset: iris.csv
Note: Tableau doesn't support native 3D, but you can simulate 3D using size or color.
Steps:
•	Drag PetalLengthCm to Columns.
•	Drag PetalWidthCm to Rows.
•	Drag SepalLengthCm to Size (in Marks card).
•	Drag Species to Color.
•	This simulates a 3D volumetric plot using color and size as the 3rd dimension.
d. Temporal Data Visualization (Simulated)
📝 Objective:
Simulate changes in flower measurements over a sequence (like time) using the Id column (1 to 150).
📊 Steps in Tableau:
1.	Load iris.csv.
2.	Drag Id to Columns.
3.	Drag PetalLengthCm (or any feature) to Rows.
4.	Drag Species to Color.
5.	Change the chart type to Line.
This simulates how petal length varies over observation ID, as if it were a time series.


Dataset: iris.csv
Steps:
•	Drag PetalLengthCm to Columns.
•	Drag PetalWidthCm to Rows.
•	Drag SepalLengthCm to Size.
•	Drag SepalWidthCm to Shape or Tooltip.
•	Drag Species to Color.
This visualizes 4+ dimensions using multiple visual encodings (scatter plot enhanced with size, color, shape).
f. Tree / Hierarchical Data Visualization (Simulated Treemap)
📝 Objective:
Group data into a hierarchy: Species → PetalLength Range.
📊 Steps in Tableau:
1.	Create a calculated field:
o	Go to Analysis → Create Calculated Field
o	Name it: Petal Length Group
o	Formula:
IF [PetalLengthCm] < 2 THEN "<2"
ELSEIF [PetalLengthCm] < 5 THEN "2-5"
ELSE ">5"
END
2.	Drag Species to Rows also drag some length to columns
3.	Drag Petal Length Group to Color.
4.	Drag Id to Size or PetalLengthCm to Size.
5.	Change show me to Treemap.
g. Network Data Visualization (Simulated)
📝 Objective:
Simulate a network between Species and Petal Length Group (as created above).
📊 Steps in Tableau:
1.	Use the same Petal Length Group calculated field.
2.	Drag Species to Rows.
3.	Drag Petal Length Group to Columns.
4.	Drag Id to Size (or COUNT(Id) for connections).
5.	Change Marks to Circle or Line.
6.	Drag Species or Petal Length Group to Color.

✔️ Interpretation: This creates a tree-like view showing how each species distributes across petal length ranges.



a. 1D (Linear) Data Visualization
🎯 Goal:
Visualize the distribution of a single variable like age.
📊 Steps:
1.	Drag age to Columns.
2.	Drag age again to Rows.
3.	Set Marks to Bar or Line.
4.	(Optional) Drag education to Color to compare by group.
✔️ Shows how one variable is distributed (age in this case).
________________________________________
🔷 b. 2D (Planar) Data Visualization
🎯 Goal:
Visualize the relationship between two numerical variables, e.g., age vs hours-per-week.
📊 Steps:
1.	Drag age to Columns.
2.	Drag hours-per-week to Rows.
3.	Change Marks to Circle or Scatter Plot.
4.	Drag workclass or education to Color.
✔️ Shows correlation or patterns between two variables (like work time vs age).
________________________________________
🔷 c. 3D (Volumetric) Data Visualization (Simulated)
🎯 Goal:
Simulate a 3D plot using size or color as the third dimension.
📊 Steps:
1.	Drag age to Columns.
2.	Drag hours-per-week to Rows.
3.	Drag education-num to Size (simulates 3rd dimension).
4.	Drag income to **Color` (for highlighting income groups).
✔️ Simulates a 3D plot using color and size to encode extra dimensions.
________________________________________
🔷 d. Temporal Data Visualization (Simulated)
⚠️ The Adult dataset doesn't have a date field, so we simulate using age.
🎯 Goal:
Track average work hours across increasing age (as if time passed).
📊 Steps:
1.	Drag age to Columns.
2.	Drag hours-per-week to Rows.
3.	Set aggregation to AVG(hours-per-week) (Right-click → Measure → Average).
4.	Set chart type to Line.
5.	Drag income or education to Color.
✔️ Simulates a temporal trend (e.g., older people working fewer/more hours).
________________________________________
🔷 e. Multidimensional Data Visualization
🎯 Goal:
Visualize 4 or more variables at once.
📊 Steps:
1.	Drag age to Columns.
2.	Drag hours-per-week to Rows.
3.	Drag education to **Shape`.
4.	Drag income to **Color`.
5.	Drag education-num to **Size`.
✔️ Shows multiple variables in a single view, using color, size, shape, position.
________________________________________
🔷 f. Tree / Hierarchical Data Visualization (Treemap)
🎯 Goal:
Group and display categories like workclass → occupation.
📊 Steps:
1.	Create a hierarchy by dragging:
o	workclass above occupation in the Data pane → Right-click → Create Hierarchy.
2.	Drag the hierarchy to Rows.
3.	Drag education-num or age to **Size`.
4.	Drag income to **Color`.
5.	Open Show Me, and select Treemap.
✔️ Creates a Treemap showing how occupation is nested within workclass.
Steps to Create Network-like Visualization:
g.
🔨 Step-by-step in Tableau:
1.	Open your adult_dataset.csv in Tableau Public.
2.	Drag workclass to Rows.
3.	Drag occupation to Columns.
4.	Drag Id (or age, or any field) to Size – or use CNT(occupation) or CNT(Id).
5.	Drag education or income to Color.
6.	Set Marks to Circle.
7.	Adjust the size and labels for clarity.
